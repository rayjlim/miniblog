# 172.1lbs & a Good start to resolutions

I have two main resolutions for the New Year.

1. Get in **better shape** (see previous post and factor in upcoming nuptials) My goal is to be under 145 lbs by May 27.
2. **Blog more**(goal is 3x a month; minimum)

Part of the plan for #1 is to blog my status each Friday; starting today. Although next week I'll be out of Friday). This will help w/ the #2 as well.
    
Weighed in at  172.1 lbs; very good sign, down 5 lbs from last week. I am wondering if the 177 lbs weigh in was due to water weight or something; I biked M/W/T; TN got me started on bringing Lean Cuisines for lunch. I've been pretty good at not chowing down during my meals.

Some tips that I jotted down that will help on the plan.
* Eat smaller portions
* Restaurant/Take out food usually come in large portions; share w/ TN (also cuts down the bill)
* Eat slower
* Drink lots of water; especially while eatting
* Go to bed at a consistent time (target is 11:30p)
* Mark exercise routine in calendar to track progress
* Incorporate weight training
